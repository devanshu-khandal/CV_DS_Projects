# DataScience mini Projects

## Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib. You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!

## Google Play Store apps and reviews
There are thousands of mobile apps available that are easy to use and can be profitable. Hence, an increasing number of applications are being produced. In this notebook, we have compared over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories to conduct a comprehensive research on the Android app industry. A deep search is done for patterns in the data to investigate growth and retention strategies.

The data set for this beginner Data science project contains two files:

1. A CSV file containing all the details of the applications on Google Play. 13 features describe a given app.
2. Another CSV file containing 100 reviews for each app is most helpful first.

## The GitHub History of the Scala Language
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts. The dataset includes the project history of [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
